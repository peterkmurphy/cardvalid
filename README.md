The Card Validation Project

Two (input1.txt and input2.txt) are
text files consisting of credit card numbers. One file - cardvalid.py
- is the Python program. If you have Python installed, you run it:

python cardvalid.py [textfile]

Where textfile is the name of a text file consisting of credit cards
numbers. If no file is provided as an argument, the program does unit
testing.

If you have the Go programming language installed, then you can run
the Go implementation as:

go run cardvalid.go

There's even a cardfunc.go (which contains the main credit card
functionality), and even a cardfunc_test.go - again for unit testing.
